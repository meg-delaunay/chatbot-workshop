# chatbot-workshop
Repo for WWCode Chatbot Workshop on 9/21

## Set Up Steps

1. Head over to [Api.ai](https://api.ai/) and create an account.
    * This will require an active GMail account!
2. Go [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) to install NodeJS and npm, which is Node's package manager. 
3. Find your favorite SDK [here](https://api.ai/docs/sdks).
    * I'll be using the NodeJS SDK -- but if you prefer another language, pick whichever you feel comfortable with!
    * Instructions for NodeJS SDK are found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apiai)
4. If using Node:
    * npm install express
    
## Outline for Workshop

1. Introduction to Api.ai and Chatbot Vocabulary
2. Creating our first Api.ai agent (topic of agent TBD)
    * Adding our first Intent!
3. Hooking our agent up to NodeJS
4. What's an Entity?  
5. Generating responses based on business logic. 
6. Fulfillment using GCloud project webhook (unlikely to get here -- but will show the necessary steps to anyone who's interested!)
