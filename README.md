# chatbot-workshop
Repo for WWCode Chatbot Workshop on 9/21

## Set Up Steps

1. Head over to [Api.ai](https://api.ai/) and create an account.
    * This will require an active GMail account!
2. Go [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) to install NodeJS and npm, which is Node's package manager. 
3. Find your favorite SDK [here](https://api.ai/docs/sdks).
    * I'll be using the NodeJS SDK -- but if you prefer another language, pick whichever you feel comfortable with!
    * Instructions for NodeJS SDK are found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apiai)
4. If using Node:
    * npm install express
